- Comprehensive documentation
- Example code and integrations

## API Endpoints

### Base URL
```
http://localhost:8121
```

### WebSocket
```
ws://localhost:18765
```

### Key Endpoints
- `GET /device/scan` - Scan for devices
- `POST /device/connect` - Connect to device
- `POST /stream/start` - Start data streaming
- `POST /data/start-recording` - Start recording session
- `GET /metrics` - System performance metrics

## Quick Start

1. Launch Link Band SDK
2. The Python server will start automatically (no setup required)
3. Click "Scan for Devices"
4. Select your Link Band device
5. Click "Connect"
6. Start streaming or recording

## Troubleshooting

### Application Won't Start (macOS)
If you see "Link Band SDK is damaged and can't be opened":
1. Open Terminal
2. Run: `xattr -cr /Applications/Link\ Band\ SDK.app`
3. Try opening the app again

### Server Connection Issues
- The Python server starts automatically when you launch the app
- Check if port 8121 is already in use by another application
- Try restarting the application

### Device Not Found
- Ensure Bluetooth is enabled
- Check device battery level
- Try restarting the device
- Move closer to the computer

### Connection Issues
- Restart the application
- Check for other Bluetooth interference
- Update your system's Bluetooth drivers

### Data Export Issues
- Ensure sufficient disk space
- Check write permissions
- Try a different export format

## Technical Details

### Bundled Components
