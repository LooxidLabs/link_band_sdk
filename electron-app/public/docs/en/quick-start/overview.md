# Overview

Link Band SDK is an integrated development environment for **Looxid Labs'** next-generation ultra-lightweight EEG band **Link Band 2.0**. It is designed to enable researchers, developers, and anyone interested in EEG data to easily and quickly collect, analyze, and utilize EEG data.

## Key Features

### 🧠 Real-time Data Collection
- **EEG (Electroencephalography)**: 2-channel high-quality signals (250Hz sampling)
- **PPG (Photoplethysmography)**: Heart rate and blood flow measurement
- **ACC (Accelerometer)**: 3-axis motion detection
- **Battery**: Real-time power status monitoring

### ⚡ Advanced Signal Processing

**EEG Signal Processing**
- Real-time noise filtering (50/60Hz power line noise removal)
- Frequency band analysis (Alpha 8-13Hz, Beta 13-30Hz, Theta 4-8Hz, Delta 0.5-4Hz)
- Signal Quality Index (SQI) automatic calculation and real-time monitoring
- EEG index calculation (attention, relaxation, stress level)
- Artifact removal (eye blinks, EMG noise)

**PPG Signal Processing**
- Real-time heart rate (HR) calculation and variability analysis
- Heart Rate Variability (HRV) time/frequency domain analysis
- Blood flow change monitoring and pulse waveform analysis
- Stress index and autonomic nervous system activity assessment
- PPG signal quality evaluation and motion artifact correction

### 🚀 Developer-Friendly
- Full REST API support
- WebSocket real-time streaming
- Python/JavaScript client libraries provided
- Cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux)
